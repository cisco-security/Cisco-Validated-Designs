In this validated design, we explore an end-to-end architecture for a cloud native application ecosystem. We identify critical business flows, attack surfaces and corresponding required security controls. This guide is focused on Amazon Web Services (AWS) as cloud service provider. The solution covers detailed design implementation steps for the AWS infrastructure as well as the application and Cisco security solutions integrations to achieve a Cisco Validated Design (CVD) for a cloud native application in AWS.
