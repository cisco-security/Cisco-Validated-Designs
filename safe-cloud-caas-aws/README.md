In this validated design, we explore an end-to-end architecture of a cloud native application ecosystem. We identify critical business flows, attack surfaces and corresponding security controls required for a given cloud native application environment. This guide is focused on Amazon Web Services (AWS) as cloud service provider. The solution covers detailed design implementation steps for AWS infrastructure as well as the application and security solutions integration to achieve a Cisco Validated Design (CVD) for a cloud native application in AWS.
