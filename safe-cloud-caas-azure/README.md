![alt text](https://github.com/cisco-security/Cisco-Validated-Designs/blob/master/safe-cloud-caas-azure/images/SecureCICD.svg)  

In this validated design, we explore an end-to-end architecture for a cloud native application ecosystem. We identify critical business flows, attack surfaces and corresponding required security controls. This guide is focused on Microsoft Azure as cloud service provider. The solution covers detailed design implementation steps for the Azure infrastructure as well as a demo application and Cisco security solutions integrations to achieve a Cisco Validated Design (CVD).
